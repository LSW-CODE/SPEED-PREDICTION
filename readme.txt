First, use the 'PSO-VMD.py' and obtain the [K, Alpha] for VMD.

Second, use the 'VMD.py', and obtain the decomposed components. (from IMF1 to IMF6)

Third, use the 'AM-Bi-LSTM.py' to predict each component processed by VMD.

Finally, add the results of the Internally controlled items and the results of the Externally controlled items.

Notes: Using different parameters will yield different results, and the table named 'data' presents one of them.
